This is my implementation of [Free Code Camp's](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) Visualize Data with a Choropleth Map project.

[view in browser](https://hankadev.github.io/d3_choropleth_map/) 

## Objective

Built an app that is functionally similar to [this](https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/EZKqza/).
Fulfill the below user stories. Give it your own personal style. You can use HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and the D3 svg-based visualization library.

Datasets provided by freeCodeCamp [US Education Data](https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/testable-projects-fcc/data/choropleth_map/for_user_education.json) and [US Country Data](https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/testable-projects-fcc/data/choropleth_map/counties.json).

User stories:

- **User Story #1:** My choropleth should have a title with a corresponding `id="title"`.
- **User Story #2:** My choropleth should have a description element with a corresponding `id="description"`.
- **User Story #3:** My choropleth should have counties with a corresponding `class="county"` that represent the data.
- **User Story #4:** There should be at least 4 different fill colors used for the counties.
- **User Story #5:** My counties should each have `data-fips` and `data-education` properties containing their corresponding fips and education values.
- **User Story #6:** My choropleth should have a county for each provided data point.
- **User Story #7:** The counties should have data-fips and data-education values that match the sample data.
- **User Story #8:** My choropleth should have a legend with a corresponding `id="legend"`.
- **User Story #9:** There should be at least 4 different fill colors used for the legend.
- **User Story #10:** I can mouse over an area and see a tooltip with a corresponding `id="tooltip"` which displays more information about the area.
- **User Story #11:** My tooltip should have a `data-education` property that corresponds to the `data-education` of the active area.
